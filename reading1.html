        A question I had is whether the website had changed for the Astro Restaurant because I visited the site, and it did not have the same home page layout as it did in the article. When Toph mentioned that a lot of websites use templated website builders, that is what the site looked like now. 
        <br>I also liked the small discussion on how some authors have trouble with websites for their books and whether the reason why restaurant websites have a more unique experience is because they are physical places. The Dimes website paints the restaurant as a quaint, small area with many pops of color.
       <br> And that can be seen in the Yelp and Instagram photos online. I feel like there is much more color that provides the simplistic yet daring feel that the restaurant has. The Kaijistsu website feels more like an informational site with the latest updates and articles.
