        This reading reminds me of a lot of discussions that occur in like sci fi movies with the inclusion of robots in mankind’s daily life.
        I really like the author’s inclusion about asking about how much of humanity is in the piece rather than how much of AI was used to generate it. 
        I do think that evaluating work through how much of a person’s personality is expressed is important. 
        LLMs are useful to synthensize and restructure your work, but to fully rely on them to create images and texts for you feels wrong. 
        What would the author say to AI work that is fed information about a person to develop the image or text? 
        Certain limitations and rules are told to the AI to ensure that it produces the best result. Is that still wrong? 
        Would the work still express humanity or can it clearly be written by an AI?
