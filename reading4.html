       I really loved this line out of the entire article: "<i>alluding to the technological friction 
       and social pressures that often come along with creating and maintaining a website in 2018.</i>" 
       It just reminds me that times are constantly changing and that in some way, we need to remind ourselves 
       of those changes and adjust. That conversation reminded me of the first article about restaurant websites.
       I think this article properly explained what it means to view a website as a room. Side note: I really
       love how reflective these articles are in relation to the internet/web/AI. Before this calss, I did not 
       really imagine how websites have certain design elements present within them. I viewed design more as 
       a physical activity, through fabric and art.
