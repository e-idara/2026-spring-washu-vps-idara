        The idea of thinking about wearable technology like airpods as cyborgs is truly interesting. I always think of cyborg like the character from 
        Teen Titans and the main character in the book called Cinder. I want to believe we will never get to the point where tehcnology will make up our genetic 
        composition, but sometimes it is worrying to see how it plays such a big role in many people's lives. Like we sometimes cannot work without it. At first, 
        I did not understand the rooms aspect of the article, but Phoebe clarified in thinking of it in a way like your environment is adapting to you using technology.
